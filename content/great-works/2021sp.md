**Time**: Tuesdays 1:30pm - 2:20pm <br/>
**Location**: [Zoom][] *(requires @cornell.edu account)* <br/>
**Organizers**: Rachit Nigam and Adrian Sampson <br/>

This is a 1-credit seminar that meets every week to discuss classic papers in
programming languages adjacent fields.
Great works is a discussion-focused reading group. We expect participants to
read the papers and attend the seminar.

#### Reading Protocol
Presenters should work with their mentor to figure out which parts of the two
papers they will focus on.
They should send an email to Rachit on Friday before their presentation with
their paper reading requirements.
The confirmation for reading with any additional materials goes out over the
weekend on the PLDG mailing list:

      pldg-l@cornell.edu

To join, send a message to [pldg-l-request@cornell.edu][join-pldg] with the
subject "join" and a blank body.

#### Getting Papers

Please search for the paper names on Google and use Cornell's [Passkey][] to
get around paper paywalls.
