This is a 1-credit seminar that meets every week to discuss classic papers in
programming languages adjacent fields.
Great works is a discussion-focused reading group. We expect participants to
read the papers and attend the seminar.

#### Reading Protocol
Our primary means of communication is through slack: [Cornell CIS #great-pl](https://cornellcis.slack.com/archives/CFKJZV78R)

Please also join the PLDG mailing list:

      pldg-l@cornell.edu

To join, send a message to [pldg-l-request@cornell.edu][join-pldg] with the
subject "join" and a blank body.

#### Presenting Papers

This seminar has two parts --- a presentation that familiarize people with the topic and help them with paper reading, and a discussion in the subsequent week with the expectation that people have a good understanding of the paper.
Aim for 20-25 minutes for your presentation, and 25-30 minutes discussion (prepare questions and slides).

#### Getting Papers

An up-to-date schedule and paper list is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PEa8WG9A0Eb3VZzn2eIOOl1Uh07t-vSmUjQsEmeGTgc/edit?usp=sharing). You can fill in your name in the empty block to claim a presentation slot.
