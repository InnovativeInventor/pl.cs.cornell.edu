# About

> I would found a research group where any programming language can be
> thoroughly studied

Cornell has been at the center of research on programming languages for more
than 50 years. We are a diverse group of researchers whose work intersects a
wide array of domains within computer science.

Notable works from Cornell include:
the [PL/C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/C) programming language,
the [NuPRL](http://www.nuprl.org) proof assistant,
[typed assembly language](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc),
the [Cyclone](https://cyclone.thelanguage.org) programming language,
the [Jif](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif) programming language,
the [Frenetic](http://www.frenetic-lang.org) family of network programming
languages,
and [unsoundness of Java and Scala's type system](http://io.livecode.ch/learn/namin/unsound).

We seek to study theoretical foundations and to build practical applications for
programming languages.
