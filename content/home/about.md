# About

> I would found a research group where any programming language can be
> thoroughly studied.

Cornell has been at the center of research on programming languages for more
than 50 years. We are a diverse group of researchers whose work intersects a
wide array of domains within computer science.

Notable works from Cornell include:
[PL/C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/C),
[NuPRL](http://www.nuprl.org),
[Typed Assembly Language](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc),
[Kleene Algebra with Tests](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/kat.pdf),
[Cyclone](https://cyclone.thelanguage.org),
[Jif](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jif),
[Frenetic](http://www.frenetic-lang.org),
and discovering the [unsoundness of Java and Scala's type system](http://io.livecode.ch/learn/namin/unsound).
