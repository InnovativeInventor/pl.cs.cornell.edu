The Programming Languages Discussion Group meets weekly to discuss papers in the area of programming languages, program analysis, and compilers. The goal is to encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and faculty with interests in this area. The seminar is open to everybody interested in languages and compilers. First-year and second-year students are especially encouraged to participate. Participating students should register for the 1-credit course CS 7190.

Talks will be advertised on the `pldg-l@cornell.edu` list. To join, send a message to [pldg-l-request@cornell.edu][join-pldg] with the subject "join" and a blank body.
