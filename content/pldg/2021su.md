The Programming Languages Discussion Group meets weekly to discuss papers in the

encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and
faculty with interests in this area. The seminar is open to everybody interested
in languages and compilers.

Talks will be advertised on the `pldg-l@cornell.edu` list. To join, send a
