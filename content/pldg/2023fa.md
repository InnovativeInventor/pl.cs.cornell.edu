The Programming Languages Discussion Group meets weekly to discuss papers in the
area of programming languages, program analysis, and compilers. The goal is to
encourage interactions and discussions between students, researchers, and
faculty with interests in this area. The seminar is open to everybody interested
in languages and compilers. First-year and second-year students are especially
encouraged to participate. 

Talks will be advertised on the `pldg-l@cornell.edu` list. To join, send a
message to [pldg-l-request@cornell.edu][join-pldg] with the subject "join" and a
blank body.

PLDG meets both in person and on [Zoom][]. Please discuss with the czars if you
plan to present virtually.
